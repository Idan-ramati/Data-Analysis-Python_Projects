# Python_Projects
Repository for my data analysis projects using Python and Jupyter Notebooks

- project1: Exploratory Data Analysis using jupyter notebook. 
The work will be based on a CSV named “imdb_top_movies.csv”

- project 2: K-Means. I will analyze air traffic passenger statistics by the airline with the k-means algorithm.
The work will be based on a CSV named “Customer_Shopping_Habits.csv”.
Note: The data provided has been normalized, which is why you might observe negative values in columns such as age. These negative values do not imply that the age is less than zero; rather, they indicate that the value is below the average.
